⚡ **ytdown** — A fat-free, quick, open source YouTube downloader.

## What is this?
ytdown is a quick, small node.js YouTube downloader/converter, that can download any^ YouTube video in mp3 or mp4, just by providing a video link.

## Don't these already exist? Why did you make your own?
I made this since I regularly download songs to listen to offline, but usually I run into an issue: the existing downloaders either break lots, or are so full of ads they just hurt. I made my own for personal use so I could download my songs without the need to go through the pain of ads. I've also made it open source and hosted a public version for others to use, because why not? :smile:

## Can I run my own copy?
Of course! I'll soon document how in the wiki, for now it's prettu simple: just download the files, run `npm install` then `node .` to start it locally on port 3000.
