⚡ **ytdown** — A fat-free, quick, open source YouTube downloader.

## What is this?
ytdown is a quick, small node.js YouTube downloader/converter, that can download any* YouTube video in mp3 or mp4, just by providing a video link.  
  
*\* limted to non-protected videos, some cannot be downloaded due to country or law/copyright restrictions.*

## Don't these already exist? Why did you make your own?
I made this since I regularly download songs to listen to offline, but usually I run into an issue: the existing downloaders either break lots, or are so full of ads they just hurt. I made my own for personal use so I could download my songs without the need to go through the pain of ads. I've also made it open source and hosted a public version for others to use, because why not? It does help. :smile:

## Can I run my own copy?
Of course! I'll soon document how in the wiki, for now it's prettu simple: just download the files, run `npm install` then `node .` to start it locally on port 3000.

## Ideas/current to-do list:
PS: If you think you could do any of these, go ahead and submit a PR with the code and I'll happily add it!  
  
[ ] Delete downloaded files after 24 hours?
[ ] Instead of using a random string for the downloaded file, get the video title/ID and set it as that.
[ ] Add a "downloading" page to show progress?
